           <p class="about-me"> Hello my name is William Perez. I enjoy coding especially when you see all the amazing projects you can build. I am not a coding ninja yet but with dedication and effort I will achieve that goal. <blockquote>  "Nothing worth having was ever achieved without effort" — Theodore Roosevelt </blockquote> </p>
           <p class="about-me"> I would like to make apps to help people in any way possible. I feel very fortunate to have met many smart and caring people that helped me in my journey to learning web development and I think one way to appreciate is giving back to other people. <blockquote>
             "There's an appreciation of the whole picture of life as opposed to just ambition and circumstance and all the stuff that happens in this business. You find yourself lucky enough to be working with somebody really talented who you know and who you trust." —  Wayne Knight </blockquote>
